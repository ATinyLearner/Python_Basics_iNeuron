    "##### 1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "##### Ans: They are True and False. \n",
    "##### We write them without quotation just like below:\n",
    "##### True \n",
    "##### False\n",
    "##### 2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "##### Ans: They are AND OR NOT .\n",
    "##### 3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).\n",
    "##### Ans:\n",
    "##### A\tB\tAND\tOR\n",
    "##### True\tTrue\tTrue\tTrue\n",
    "##### True\tFalse\tFalse\tTrue\n",

    "##### <\tLess Than\n",
    "##### >= \tGreater Equal to\n",

    "##### 6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators? Describe a condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "##### Equal to operator ==\n",
    "##### Assignment operator =\n",
    "##### Equal to operator is a comparison operator. Used to compare the equality of 2 values . Assignment operator is used to assign values inside a variable.\n",

    "##### 8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.\n",
    "##### spam=0\n",
    "##### if spam==1:\n",
    "##### \tprint(“Hello”)\n",

    "##### 9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?\n",
    "##### Ans: Ctrl + c to give a keyboard interrupt\n",
    "##### 10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "##### Ans: Break actually breaks a loop and continue skip a specific loop cycle and continue with next loop cycle.\n",
    "##### 11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?\n",
    "##### Ans:range(10),range(0,10) and range(0,10,1) are same. They starts from 0 and ends at 9.\n",
    "##### 12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.\n",
    "##### Ans: \n",
    "##### Using for loop \n",
    "##### for i in range(1,11):\n",
    "##### \tprint(i)\n",
